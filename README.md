# ðŸ§  Supervised Learning & Machine Learning Concepts

Welcome to the **Supervised Learning** repository! This repo features a set of hands-on Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate the core principles of machine learning, including both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and recommender systems.

Each notebook includes practical code, clear explanations, and visualizations to help understand the underlying ML concepts.
